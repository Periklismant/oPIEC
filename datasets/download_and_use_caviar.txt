For testing reasons, there is an example of CAVIAR input in the /inputDatasets/examples/ folder.

Download link for full CAVIAR with noise: https://owncloud.skel.iit.demokritos.gr/index.php/s/An9iCqhoZJiZuZj

After downloading, extract the zip contents in this folder. Afterwards, /inputDatasets/caviar/ should contain two subfolders: 'original/' and 'enhanced/'.

We will be using the 'original' version of CAVIAR (which does not include the 'abrupt' input event).
CAVIAR structure:
- caviar/original contains 30 subfolders which correspond to the staged videos of the dataset. Note that there are three versions of video '27' because of disagreements regarding the annotation of that video.
- Every video folder contains 4 subfolders. One of them contains the ground truth, i.e. all the complex events that take place in that video along with the temporal intervals of their occurrences. The remaining subfolders, named 'smooth', 'intermediate' and 'strong', contain different versions of the dataset with varying noise intensity. This artificial noise has been added to CAVIAR using a Gamma distribution. In short, in CAVIAR 'smooth', noise has been added to short term activities (e.g. 'walking', 'running'). The 'smooth' noise folder contains 16 subfolders which are named after the mean value of the Gamma distribution used to associate the short term activities with noise. The 'intermediate' and 'strong' noise folders contain similar subfolders. However, in the case of CAVIAR 'intermediate', noise is also added to coordinate and orientation of the persons in the video. CAVIAR 'strong' contains, apart from the aforementioned types of noise, spurious short term activities which correspond to non-existent persons ("ghosts") to complicate the recognition task.
- Finally, in '/caviar/original/videoName/noiseVersion/gammaMean/', there are two ProbLog files. One contains the appearance and orientation fluents of persons and objects, while the second contains the coordinates of the agents and the short term activities. 

In '/inputDatasets/examples/' there is a pair of such files, for testing purposes, which are the same as in '/caviar/original/01-Walk1/smooth/1.0/', i.e. the input data of the first video of CAVIAR with 'smooth' noise generated by a Gamma distribution with mean=1. 
The input of Prob-EC is set by default to the example Problog files. However, the user may change the input files by changing the appropriate paths in the code file: '/src/Prob-EC/caviar/er_prob_orig_cached.pl'. Executing Prob-EC--oPIEC is easier via the script '/scripts/run_caviar.sh'.
