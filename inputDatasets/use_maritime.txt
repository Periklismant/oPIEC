For the use case of maritime monotoring, Prob-EC and oPIEC have been tested on the publicly available Brest dataset which can be downloaded from here: https://owncloud.skel.iit.demokritos.gr/index.php/s/EKJtSdvpTGCfKm1 (NOTE: this is the original, crisp version.)

This dataset contains 18M position signals from 5K vessels sailing in the Atlantic Ocean around the port of Brest, France, between October 1st 2015 and 31st March 2016. Additionally, a spatial preprocessing module produced 374K spatio-temporal events linking vessels with, among others, 263 fishing areas and 1.2K Natura 2000 areas, as well as vessels with other vessels. Also, a trajectory synopsis generator labelled 4.6M position signals as critical. However, there is no uncertainty present in the dataset and it cannot be used directly by Prob-EC. 

For that reason, we have injected artificial noise to the simple events of the Brest Dataset. Every input indication, including the spatial and critical events, is assigned a probability value which is inversely proportional to the distance of the respictive vessel from the nearest coast. This method assumes that signals become less reliable the further a vessel is from any signal receiver. Also, we have gaussian white noise on top of these values to make the recognition task more rigorous.

Finally, another preprocessing step adds information which is used to accelarate the recognition of Prob-EC, e.g. a fact which indicate that two vessels are (or will be) close to each other.

A portion of the noisy Brest dataset can be found in the /inputDatasets/examples/ folder ('maritime.pl' and 'maritime_short.pl'). A probabilistic version of the full dataset will be available in the future. These examples may be executed via /scripts/run_maritime.sh. You may change the input file and the parameters of the experiments through the declarations in the code of the script.
