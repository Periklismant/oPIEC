## Prob-EC output

A result file is produced after each execution of Prob-EC. It contains the probabilities of every target complex event at each time-point. Use an execution script (or the "fixoutput.sh" script) to separate the complex events and create a different file for each event in the Prob-EC_output/preprocessed folder.
